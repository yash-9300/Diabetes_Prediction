#  Diabetes_Prediction

The objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.










## About Dataset

The dataset is provided by @MeriSKILL during my internship as a Data Analyst intern .This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.






# Details 

For this project, I used a variety of machine learning techniques especially leveraging the power of Logistic Regression Models . to build a predictive model that can predict whether a person is at risk of developing diabetes. I trained the model on the dataset which contained information about the following factors: Glucose level,BMI,Age,BloodPressure,Other health conditions.

The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 79% on a held-out test set, which is very promising for a first project




# Model Deployment

Model deployment is the crucial bridge between predictive insights and real-world impact, where algorithms translate into actionable solutions

Deploying a machine learning model involves transforming complex algorithms into user-friendly applications that seamlessly integrate into existing systems.

Deploying a machine learning model marks the culmination of rigorous development, testing, and validation processes, unlocking its potential to drive real-world outcomes.
